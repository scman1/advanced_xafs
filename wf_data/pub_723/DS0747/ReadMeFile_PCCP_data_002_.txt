In this work, high energy resolution fluorescence detection (HERFD), X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), X-ray emission, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) have been used to probe the electronic structural properties of the mechanochemically prepared LaMnO3. Moreover, in situ studies using near ambient pressure (NAP)-XPS, to follow performance of milled LaMnO3 during deN2O,  and high pressure energy dispersive EXAFS studies, to mimic the preparation conditions, have also been performed.
